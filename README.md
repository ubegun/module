# Project struct

When structuring a Go project, it's essential to strike a balance between simplicity and scalability. While there is no one-size-fits-all structure, here's a recommended project structure that can be a good starting point for most Go projects:

myproject/
  |- cmd/
  |   |- myapp/
  |   |   |- main.go
  |
  |- internal/
  |   |- pkg1/
  |   |   |- ...
  |   |
  |   |- pkg2/
  |   |   |- ...
  |
  |- pkg/
  |   |- mypackage/
  |   |   |- ...
  |
  |- api/
  |   |- ...
  |
  |- web/
  |   |- ...
  |
  |- config/
  |   |- ...
  |
  |- scripts/
  |   |- ...
  |
  |- test/
  |   |- ...
  |
  |- docs/
  |   |- ...
  |
  |- README.md


Now, let's go through the purpose of each directory in this structure:

- cmd/: Contains the main application entry points. Each subdirectory within cmd/ represents a separate application or service.
- internal/: Holds internal packages that are specific to your project. These packages are not intended to be imported by external projects.
- pkg/: Contains packages that can be imported by external projects. Each subdirectory within pkg/ represents a separate package or library.
- api/: Includes code related to APIs, such as handlers, middleware, and route definitions.
- web/: Contains code related to web user interfaces, such as templates, static assets, and web-specific handlers.
- config/: Holds configuration files for your project.
- scripts/: Includes scripts or utility tools for your project.
- test/: Contains tests for your project. Organize tests based on the corresponding package structure.
- docs/: Includes project documentation, such as README files, design documents, or usage guidelines.

In addition to these directories, you can also include other directories like data/ for storing data files, cmd/ for command-line utilities, or migrations/ for database migrations.

Remember to choose a structure that aligns with the size and complexity of your project. You can adjust and adapt the structure as your project evolves. Also, make sure to follow Go's package naming conventions and use Go Modules for dependency management.

Keep in mind that this is just a suggested structure, and you should tailor it to your specific project requirements and team preferences.
